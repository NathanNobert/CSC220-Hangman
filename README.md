This is a hangman mobile game made for Android devices. It was made for a school computer science project while learning about software engineering. This project started roughly October 1, 2017 and was finished December 15, 2017. Our app is complete and it contains the basic features of hangman, 3 difficulties, statistics about your wins and friendly graphics and user interface. The user is given a game screen that displays a keyboard to click letters, a dunk tank that is used to dunk the hangman if the user fails, and an amount of underscores representing the length of the hidden word. The user must guess enough correct letters to guess the word before guessing too many wrong letters that will send the hangman to a wet fall. The user gets six wrong guesses and is given a hint feature they can use that describes or provides a sentence relative to the hidden word.
